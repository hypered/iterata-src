This is the original HTML versions of the Motherboard-generated files. These
files are "generated" at the same time as the other files (`.md`, `.hs`,
`.html`). This means they come from the SQLite database. Normally, the only
difference with files downloaded from the Belgian official journal web site is
that they were converted to UTF-8.
